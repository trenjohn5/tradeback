## Product Requirements Document (PRD)
### **Product Title**: **TradeBack - Algorithmic Trading Backtesting Tool**

---

### **Overview**
**TradeBack** is a comprehensive backtesting platform that enables traders to build, test, and visualize their trading strategies using historical market data. Through an intuitive strategy builder and powerful backtesting engine, users can design custom trading algorithms without coding experience, simulate them against real market conditions, and visualize trade performance in an engaging and insightful way.

---

### **Goals**
1. Provide a **user-friendly, drag-and-drop strategy builder** that allows users to define and build custom trading strategies.
2. Enable users to **backtest** these strategies on **historical price data** and evaluate their performance.
3. Show real-time **visualization** of backtest results, including **trade execution**, technical analysis, and performance metrics.
4. Educate users by providing real-time explanations of **why each trade was triggered** based on the strategy’s logic.

---

### **Target Audience**
1. **Retail Traders**: Beginner to intermediate traders who are interested in testing and refining their strategies but lack advanced programming skills.
2. **Algorithmic Traders**: Traders who want to quickly prototype and test new strategies before deployment in live markets.
3. **Quants and Data Scientists**: Users who need an easy interface to backtest strategies, visualize results, and iterate on ideas.

     - Executes the strategy against the data to simulate **buy** and **sell** orders.
     - Calculates key performance metrics, including:
       - **Profit and loss (PnL)**
       - **Win rate**
       - **Maximum drawdown**
       - **Total return**
       - **Sharpe ratio** (for risk-adjusted returns)
     - Generates an output file for each backtest session with detailed trade logs.
     - Allows users to test their strategy over different time periods (e.g., 1 month, 1 year, or custom).
   - **Performance Display**:
     - Displays a **line chart** of the price data and overlays it with **buy** and **sell** signals.
     - Interactive **trade details** (entry price, exit price, PnL).
     - Summary of backtest performance metrics at the top.

#### 3. **Visualization and Replay**
   - **Objective**: Visualize how the strategy performs over time, with dynamic feedback on key trades.
   - **Functionality**:
     - **Speeded-up replay** of the backtest results, showing price movements and when buy/sell orders occur.
     - **Trade markers** on the price chart to highlight when a buy or sell was triggered.
     - **Explanatory tooltips** or pop-ups that show **why** each trade was executed based on the strategy’s logic (e.g., "RSI crosses above 70, indicating overbought condition").
     - **Key technical indicators** displayed on the chart (e.g., Moving Averages, RSI).
     - **Interactive chart controls** for adjusting time intervals, indicators, and viewing specific trades.
     - **Side panel** for live metrics updates (e.g., win rate, total PnL, max drawdown).

#### 4. **User Dashboard**
   - **Objective**: Provide a space for users to manage their strategies, view previous backtests, and access key metrics.
   - **Functionality**:
     - **List of saved strategies** with the option to **edit, delete, or clone**.
     - **Backtest history**, showing results for each backtest with clickable links to review detailed results.
     - **Portfolio summary** showing overall performance for all strategies tested.
     - **Metrics display** for the latest backtest, including the total profit/loss, number of trades, and performance graphs.
     - Option to **download results** as CSV or JSON for external analysis.

### **User Stories**

1. **As a retail trader**, I want to build a trading strategy using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface, so I don’t need to know how to code.
2. **As an algorithmic trader**, I want to backtest my strategy with real historical data, so I can evaluate its effectiveness before using it in live trading.
3. **As a data-driven trader**, I want to see key performance metrics like win rate, total return, and Sharpe ratio, so I can assess the robustness of my strategy.
4. **As a beginner trader**, I want to see visual explanations of why trades were triggered, so I can learn about different strategies and improve my own.
5. **As a user**, I want to be able to replay my backtest at different speeds and analyze the trades in real-time.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Scalability**: The system must support up to 10,000 users running simultaneous backtests without significant degradation in performance.
2. **Data Availability**: The tool should support historical price data for major assets (stocks, ETFs, forex, etc.) with a minimum of 5 years of data available for backtesting.
3. **Security**: User data and strategy logic should be stored securely with proper authentication mechanisms. Use OAuth for user authentication and HTTPS for secure communication.
4. **Performance**: The backtesting engine should be capable of processing 1-minute granularity data for at least 1 year of historical data within 2-3 minutes of real-time processing.
5. **Availability**: The app should have a **99.9% uptime** and be available globally, with response times of less than 2 seconds for loading charts and running backtests.

---

### **Technical Architecture**

1. **Frontend**:
   - **React** or **Vue.js** for dynamic UI components and interactions.
   - **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive layouts.
   - **Chart.js** or **Plotly.js** for interactive price charts and visualizations.
   - **WebSocket** or **AJAX** for real-time updates during the backtest simulation.

2. **Backend**:
   - **Flask** for handling HTTP requests, managing user authentication, and serving the API for backtesting and strategy building.
   - **Python** for the backtesting engine, running calculations, and fetching historical price data via APIs (Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance).
   - **SQLAlchemy** for handling user data and saved strategies.
   - **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL** for database management.

3. **Data Integration**:
   - Use APIs like **Yahoo Finance** or **Alpha Vantage** to fetch historical OHLC data for backtesting.
   - The app should support **minute-level granularity** for short-term strategies.

4. **Deployment**:
   - **Docker** for containerization of the backend and database.
   - Deploy the app on **AWS EC2** or **Heroku** for scalable cloud hosting.
   - Use **Amazon S3** or **Google Cloud Storage** for storing user data and backtest results.

### **Timeline**
1. **Phase 1 (Day 1)**:
   - Build the strategy builder UI with drag-and-drop functionality.
   - Set up basic backtesting engine to handle historical data fetch and trade simulations.
   - Implement visualization with interactive charts showing backtest results.

2. **Phase 2 (Week 1)**:
   - Add performance metrics like win rate, total return, and max drawdown.
   - Improve UI for viewing trade details and key strategy insights.
   - Integrate with external data sources for fetching OHLC data.

3. **Phase 3 (Week 2)**:
   - Enhance backtest speed and accuracy with more granular data (e.g., minute-level data).
   - Add user authentication and dashboard for managing strategies.
   - Refine UI to improve overall user experience and responsiveness.

---

### **Risks and Mitigation**
1. **Risk**: Integrating with multiple data sources (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage) may result in inconsistent data formats or API downtime.
   - **Mitigation**: Use fallback mechanisms and cache data locally to avoid reliance on external sources.

2. **Risk**: Performance may degrade with large datasets or multiple users running backtests simultaneously.
   - **Mitigation**: Use **cloud-based horizontal scaling** to manage user load and improve backtest speed.

3. **Risk**: Complexity in visualizing trade logic and performance metrics could overwhelm beginners.
   - **Mitigation**: Provide simple tooltips, tutorial videos, and interactive guides.
